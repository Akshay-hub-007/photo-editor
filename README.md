For more details, see the code and UI for each feature in the `components/` and `app/` folders.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:
```powershell
# Install and run
npm install
npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
```

Hot reloading is enabled â€” edit files under the `app/` or `components/` folders and your browser will update automatically.

Notes:
- This is a Next.js (app router) project. Files live under `app/` and shared UI in `components/`.
- Fonts are optimized using Next.js built-in font tooling.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

Troubleshooting (common issue):
- Windows is case-insensitive but Linux (used by Vercel) is case-sensitive. File name casing mismatches (for example `Canvas.jsx` vs `canvas.jsx`) will build locally but fail on Vercel. Keep filenames consistent.

Environment variables
- Copy `.env.local.example` (if present) or create a `.env.local` in the repo root with the required variables (do NOT commit secrets):
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
   - `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL`
   - `CLERK_JWT_ISSUER_DOMAIN`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_IMAGEKIT_PUBLIC_KEY`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_IMAGEURL_UR_ENDPOINT`
   - `IMAGEKIT_PRIVATE_KEY`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_UNPLASH_ACCESS_KEY`

Keep `.env.local` out of version control. Add it to `.gitignore` if it's not already ignored.

Development checklist
- Node.js (recommended LTS)
- npm or yarn/pnpm
- `npm install` then `npm run dev`

Contributing
- Open an issue for bugs or feature requests.
- Create feature branches and open pull requests against `main`.
- Follow existing code style; prefer small, focused commits.

License
- Check the repository root for a `LICENSE` file. If none is present, add one appropriate to your project.
